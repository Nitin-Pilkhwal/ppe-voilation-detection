# PPE Violation Detection

## Overview
This project implements a PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) violation detection system using YOLOv7. The system is capable of detecting whether construction workers are wearing PPE jackets and helmets or not. Additionally, it includes a user interface built using HTML, CSS, and JS, allowing users to upload videos for detection. The output is displayed in real-time, and users also receive an email notification with a screenshot of the detection.
